# SepSanSoft

A repository for many old (really old) projects from @estebandlc's and @herchu's software company, created in the 90's. 
We developed some games, mostly in BASIC, as well as some administrative, commercial systems which were our first source of income as teenagers.

Games include _Bradly Griff_, _El Avion_ (The Plane). These are other smaller experiments are coming soon to this repo!
